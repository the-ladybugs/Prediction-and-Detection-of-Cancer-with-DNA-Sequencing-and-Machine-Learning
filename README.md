Prediction and Detection of Cancer with DNA Sequencing and Machine Learning

The work comprises of two steps. In the first step, the diagnostics a classification system is used to make a “first selection”. The patients who are almost certainly healthy should not be investigated further.
The second step: using methods of cluster analysis the hypothesis is studied which states that among the people affected by the same cancer type there are different groups which might be treated with potentially different methods.
The classifiers and clustering algorithms used will be chosen after various testing. The goal is to automatically classify cancer patients into groups based on clinically measurable disease- specific variables in order to treat them with potentially different methods. Since every cancer is different, the treatment will also be different and this is the fundamental of personalized medicine.
The objective of this project is to explore the capability of unsupervised machine learning techniques. These techniques inherently involve less human expertise and interaction than supervised methods.
